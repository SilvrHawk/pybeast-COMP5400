    "pyBEAST is a python implementation of Bioinspired Evolutionary Agent-based Simulation Toolkit (BEAST), an educational tool to help students to explore concepts of bio-inspired computing and game development. BEAST provides a modular framework that allows users to create and interact with simple objects and agents within a 2D environment. Agents could for example be representations of animals, robots, or other abstract objects.\n",

    "In BEAST, agents can be equiped with sensors that detect objects or other agents within their vicinity. Users can specify the control logic of these agents to determine how they respond to sensor stimuli. This flexibility allows users to design agents that display complex autonomous behaviours, such as obstacle avoidance, pathfinding and hunting."

After each generation, the genetic algorithm randomly selects pairs of individuals called parents. Agents that achieve higher fitness scores during the assessments will be selected with a higher probability. Once a pair of parents is selected, the genetic algorithm combines their genomes to generate a new pair of agents referred to as children. This combination process involves random crossovers and mutations of the parent genomes which will be explained later.
